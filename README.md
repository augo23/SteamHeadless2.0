# SteamHeadless2.0
This is an updated version of the Steam Headless project

Please take this and make it better. I have it running on my Arc a380. I don't want to maintain this, so anyone can take this over. 

The Goal: Make a newer version of the SteamHeadless project that uses updated packages and Debain Bookworm (can be Trixie I believe by changing the tag). I used the KasmVNC OpenBox because of its lightweight nature.
